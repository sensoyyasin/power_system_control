# Power System Control
Power System Control with Matlab

We use matlab to model closed-loop control systems and study their behavior. We use matlab for everything from feedback control systems to more complex tasks. To examine the transient and steady-state responses of systems, we find steady-state errors and stability in second-order systems by using functions such as nyquist or root locus to find the roots of the system. We write code in Matlab with the Rooth-Hurwitz criterion. We use functions such as rooth locus rlocus(a,b) for the locus of the roots.
